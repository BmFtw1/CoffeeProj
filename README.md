This application requires the user to create an account using email and a password before any other action can be taken, this application currently prioritise on the map feature, in which a user is able to access google map and upload a picture to the user's current location, the image is then saved in Firebase storage.

This web application will see further development in terms of features and complexity, the code structure and syntax was not the main focus therefore require further polish. This is the first vue 3 application created using firebase/firebase storage as the backend.
The map function will see further development as currently after the image is uploaded to the firebase storage and displayed on the Google map API, upon refresh of the page the image is not saved on the map.
Further features will be implemented and style will be further polished.
